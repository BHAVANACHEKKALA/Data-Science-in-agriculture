The basic difficulty of statistical analysis of real data is that it is prepared or presented in a form that is not convenient for machine methods of statistical analysis. Therefore, this project shows methods of automatic pre-preparation of real data for such cases. The next problem is the ability to competently manipulate and transform big data in order to obtain a convenient statistical report both in tabular form and in the form of graphs.

Therefore, the main goal that we are to achieve in this project is learning how to download, pre-process and conduct a basic statistical analysis of Economic accounts for agriculture and present it on interactive maps.
The statistical data was obtained from the https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/databrowser/view/aact_eaa01/default/table?lang=en.
